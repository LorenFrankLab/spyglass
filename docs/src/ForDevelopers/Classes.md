## Design Goals

The Spyglass mixin architecture addresses several key challenges in managing
DataJoint pipelines:

### Problem: Code Duplication

Without mixins, every table would need to re-implement common operations like:

- Fetching NWB files
- Permission checks before deletion
- Logging for export tracking
- Helper functions for common queries

### Solution: Modular Mixins

Spyglass uses a **mixin pattern** where each mixin provides a focused set of
related functionality:

- **Separation of concerns**: Each mixin handles one responsibility
- **Reusability**: Tables inherit only needed functionality
- **Maintainability**: Changes to shared logic happen in one place
- **Extensibility**: New mixins can be added without modifying existing code

### Special Case: Analysis File Management

The **AnalysisMixin** provides specialized functionality for `AnalysisNwbfile`
tables. When combined with **SpyglassAnalysis**, it enables custom
user-specific analysis file tables for transaction lock isolation in multi-user
environments.

**See also:** [Custom Analysis Tables](./Management.md#custom-analysis-tables)

---

## Mixin Organization

Spyglass mixins are organized in `src/spyglass/utils/mixins/` with the following structure:

### Base Layer

**BaseMixin** (`mixins/base.py`)

- Foundation for most mixins
- Provides: `_logger`, `_test_mode`, `_spyglass_version`, `_graph_deps`
- Used by: All mixins except `FetchMixin`

### Independent Mixins

These mixins inherit from `BaseMixin` and provide focused functionality:

**CautiousDeleteMixin** (`mixins/cautious_delete.py`)

- Permission checks before deletion
- Validates user is on same team as session experimenter
- See [Mixin Features: Delete Permission](../Features/Mixin.md#delete-permission-checks)

**PopulateMixin** (`mixins/populate.py`)

- Enhanced `populate()` with non-daemon process pools
- Disable transaction protection for long-running populates
- See [Mixin Features: Populate](../Features/Mixin.md#populate-calls)

**RestrictByMixin** (`mixins/restrict_by.py`)

- Long-distance restrictions with `<<` and `>>` operators
- Navigate complex foreign key relationships
- See [Mixin Features: Long-Distance Restrictions](../Features/Mixin.md#long-distance-restrictions)

**HelperMixin** (`mixins/helpers.py`)

- Miscellaneous helper functions
- `file_like()` - restrict by filename substring
- `find_insert_fail()` - debug IntegrityErrors

**AnalysisMixin** (`mixins/analysis.py`)

- Analysis file creation and management
- Methods: `create()`, `add()`, `add_nwb_object()`, `add_units()`, `cleanup()`
- Used exclusively by `AnalysisNwbfile` tables
- See [Analysis File Tables](../Features/AnalysisTables.md)

### Fetch/Export Chain

These mixins form a dependency chain for NWB file fetching and export logging:

**FetchMixin** (`mixins/fetch.py`)

- Provides: `fetch_nwb()`, `fetch_pynapple()`, `_nwb_table_tuple`
- **Does not inherit BaseMixin** (standalone)
- Detects which NWB table to fetch from (Nwbfile or AnalysisNwbfile)

**ExportMixin** (`mixins/export.py`)

- Inherits from `FetchMixin`
- Adds: `_log_fetch()`, `_log_fetch_nwb()`
- Logs file access during exports
- Handles copy-to-master for custom AnalysisNwbfile tables
- See [Export Guide](../Features/Export.md)

## Core Composite Classes

### SpyglassMixin

**Location**: `src/spyglass/utils/dj_mixin.py`

**Purpose**: The primary mixin for all Spyglass tables

**Inherits from** (in MRO order):

1. `CautiousDeleteMixin`
2. `ExportMixin` → `FetchMixin`
3. `HelperMixin`
4. `PopulateMixin`
5. `RestrictByMixin`

**Additional functionality**:

- Schema prefix validation (ensures table is in authorized schema)
- Merge table detection
- Foreign key validation (prevents multiple AnalysisNwbfile references)

**Usage**:

```python
import datajoint as dj
from spyglass.utils import SpyglassMixin

schema = dj.schema("myteam_pipeline")

@schema
class MyTable(SpyglassMixin, dj.Manual):
    definition = """
    analysis_id: int
    ---
    result: float
    """
```

**NOTE**: SpyglassMixin must be the first class inherited to ensure method
overrides work correctly.

### SpyglassMixinPart

**Location**: `src/spyglass/utils/dj_mixin.py`

**Purpose**: Specialized mixin for part tables

**Inherits from**:

- `SpyglassMixin`
- `dj.Part`

**Additional functionality**:

- Propagates delete calls from part to master table
- Handles restriction on master when deleting parts

**Usage**:

```python
@schema
class MyMaster(SpyglassMixin, dj.Manual):
    definition = """
    master_id: int
    """

    class MyPart(SpyglassMixinPart):
        definition = """
        -> master
        part_id: int
        ---
        value: float
        """
```

### SpyglassAnalysis

**Location**: `src/spyglass/utils/dj_mixin.py`

**Purpose**: Specialized mixin for custom `AnalysisNwbfile` tables

**Inherits from**:

- `SpyglassMixin` (all 5 base mixins)
- `AnalysisMixin` (analysis file operations)

**Enforces**:

- Schema naming: `{prefix}_nwbfile` (one underscore)
- Table naming: `AnalysisNwbfile` (exact match)
- Table definition: Must match master `AnalysisNwbfile`
- Auto-registration in `AnalysisRegistry`

**Usage**:

Users should import the pre-configured table rather than creating their own:

```python
# Import your user-specific table (uses database.user automatically)
from spyglass.common.custom_nwbfile import AnalysisNwbfile
```

**Why this exists**: Custom `AnalysisNwbfile` tables provide transaction lock
isolation in multi-user environments. Each user's custom table is in a separate
schema (`{username}_nwbfile`), preventing concurrent insert operations from
blocking each other.

**See also:** [Custom Analysis Tables](./Management.md#custom-analysis-tables)

## Usage Patterns

### Standard Spyglass Tables

Most Spyglass tables inherit `SpyglassMixin` + a DataJoint table type:

```python
from spyglass.utils import SpyglassMixin
import datajoint as dj

schema = dj.schema("myteam_analysis")

@schema
class MyAnalysis(SpyglassMixin, dj.Computed):
    definition = """
    -> UpstreamTable
    analysis_id: int
    ---
    result: float
    """

    def make(self, key):
        # Compute analysis
        result = process_data(key)
        self.insert1({**key, "result": result})
```

**What you get**:

- ✅ NWB file fetching (`fetch_nwb()`)
- ✅ Permission-checked deletion (`delete()`)
- ✅ Long-distance restrictions (`<<`, `>>`)
- ✅ Export logging
- ✅ Helper functions

### Custom Analysis File Tables

Use the pre-configured custom `AnalysisNwbfile` table for lock isolation:

```python
# Import from custom_nwbfile module
from spyglass.common.custom_nwbfile import AnalysisNwbfile

# Table automatically created in {username}_nwbfile schema
# Inherits SpyglassAnalysis (SpyglassMixin + AnalysisMixin)
```

**What you get**:

- ✅ All SpyglassMixin functionality
- ✅ Analysis file operations (`create()`, `add()`, `cleanup()`)
- ✅ Automatic registry tracking
- ✅ Export integration (copy-to-master)
- ✅ Lock isolation (no contention with other users)

### Referencing Custom Analysis Tables

Downstream tables can reference custom `AnalysisNwbfile` tables:

```python
from spyglass.utils import SpyglassMixin
from spyglass.common.custom_nwbfile import AnalysisNwbfile
import datajoint as dj

schema = dj.schema("myteam_results")

@schema
class MyResults(SpyglassMixin, dj.Manual):
    definition = """
    result_id: int
    ---
    -> AnalysisNwbfile  # References custom table
    metric: float
    """
```

**NOTE**: Tables should only reference ONE `AnalysisNwbfile` table (either
master or custom, not both). Spyglass validates this on table declaration.

## Class Hierarchy Reference

### Visual Overview

```
BaseMixin (foundation)
    ├─→ CautiousDeleteMixin
    ├─→ PopulateMixin
    ├─→ RestrictByMixin
    ├─→ HelperMixin
    └─→ AnalysisMixin

FetchMixin (standalone)
    └─→ ExportMixin

SpyglassMixin (composite)
    Combines: CautiousDelete + Export + Helper + Populate + RestrictBy

    ├─→ SpyglassMixinPart (+ dj.Part)
    └─→ SpyglassAnalysis (+ AnalysisMixin)
```

### Method Resolution Order (MRO)

Understanding Python's MRO helps debug which mixin's method is actually called:

**SpyglassMixin MRO**:

```
SpyglassMixin
→ CautiousDeleteMixin
→ ExportMixin
→ FetchMixin
→ HelperMixin
→ PopulateMixin
→ RestrictByMixin
→ BaseMixin
→ object
```

**SpyglassAnalysis MRO**:

```
SpyglassAnalysis
→ SpyglassMixin (all 6 mixins above)
→ AnalysisMixin
→ BaseMixin (appears twice in hierarchy)
→ object
```

**Key insight**: `BaseMixin` appears in most paths, but only initialized once due to Python's C3 linearization.
