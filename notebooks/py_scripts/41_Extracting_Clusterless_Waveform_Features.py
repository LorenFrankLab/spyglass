# This is one notebook in a multi-part series on clusterless decoding in Spyglass
#
# - To set up your Spyglass environment and database, see
#   [the Setup notebook](./00_Setup.ipynb)
# - For additional info on DataJoint syntax, including table definitions and
#   inserts, see
#   [the Insert Data notebook](./01_Insert_Data.ipynb)
# - Prior to running, please familiarize yourself with the [spike sorting
#   pipeline](./02_Spike_Sorting.ipynb) and generate input position data with
#   either the [Trodes](./20_Position_Trodes.ipynb) or DLC notebooks
#   ([1](./21_Position_DLC_1.ipynb), [2](./22_Position_DLC_2.ipynb),
#   [3](./23_Position_DLC_3.ipynb)).
#
# The goal of this notebook is to populate the `UnitWaveformFeatures` table, which depends `SpikeSortingOutput`. This table contains the features of the waveforms of each unit.
#
# While clusterless decoding avoids actual spike sorting, we need to pass through these tables to maintain (relative) pipeline simplicity. Pass-through tables keep spike sorting and clusterless waveform extraction as similar as possible, by using shared steps. Here, "spike sorting" involves simple thresholding (sorter: clusterless_thresholder).

# Finally, we extract the waveform features of each SortGroup. This is done by the `UnitWaveformFeatures` table.
#
# To set this up, we use the `WaveformFeaturesParams` to define the time around the spike that we want to use for feature extraction, and which features to extract. Here is an example of the parameters used for extraction the amplitude of the negative peak of the waveform:
#
# ```python
#
# waveform_extraction_params = {
#     "ms_before": 0.5,
#     "ms_after": 0.5,
#     "max_spikes_per_unit": None,
#     "n_jobs": 5,
#     "total_memory": "5G",
# }
# waveform_feature_params = {
#     "amplitude": {
#         "peak_sign": "neg",
#         "estimate_peak_time": False,
#     }
# }
# ```
#
# We see that we want 0.5 ms of time before and after the peak of the negative spike. We also see that we want to extract the amplitude of the negative peak, and that we do not want to estimate the peak time (since we know it is at 0 ms).
#
# You can define other features to extract such as spatial location of the spike:
#
# ```python
# waveform_extraction_params = {
#     "ms_before": 0.5,
#     "ms_after": 0.5,
#     "max_spikes_per_unit": None,
#     "n_jobs": 5,
#     "total_memory": "5G",
# }
# waveform_feature_params = {
#     "amplitude": {
#         "peak_sign": "neg",
#         "estimate_peak_time": False,
#     },
#     "spike location": {}
# }
#

# _Note_: Members of the Frank Lab can use "ampl_10_jobs_v2" instead of "amplitude"
# for significant speed improvements.
