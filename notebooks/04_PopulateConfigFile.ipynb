    "# Customizing Data Insertion into Spyglass\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to insert data into Spyglass that does not\n",
    "follow the naming or organizational format expected by Spyglass, \n",
    "or you would like to override what values are ingested into Spyglass from \n",
    "your NWB files, including missing values, follow this guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "When an NWB file is ingested into Spyglass, metadata about the session\n",
    "is first read from the NWB file and inserted into\n",
    "tables in the `common` module (e.g. `Institution`, `Lab`, `Electrode`, etc).\n",
    "However, not every NWB file has all the information required by Spyglass or\n",
    "the information in the NWB file is not in a format that Spyglass expects. For\n",
    "example, many NWB files do not contain information about the\n",
    "`DataAcquisitionDevice` or `Probe` because the NWB data standard does not yet\n",
    "have an official\n",
    "standard for specifying them. For these cases, we provide a way to customize\n",
    "how data is ingested into Spyglass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that you want to ingest an NWB file into Spyglass where the lab name\n",
    "in the file is written as \"Loren Frank Lab\" or it is not specified, but you \n",
    "know the data comes from the Loren Frank Lab. Let's say that in Spyglass,\n",
    "the lab name that is associated with sessions from the Loren Frank Lab is \n",
    "\"Frank Lab\" and you would like to use the same name in order to facilitate\n",
    "data search in Spyglass. To change the lab name when you insert your new data \n",
    "to Spyglass, you could either 1) edit the NWB file directly and then \n",
    "insert it into Spyglass, or 2) define an override value \"Frank Lab\" to be \n",
    "used instead of the value specified in the NWB file (or lack thereof).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if this is your own data and you want to make changes to\n",
    "information about how the data is interpreted, e.g., the units of measurement\n",
    "are incorrect, we recommend that you edit the NWB file directly because the \n",
    "file or derivatives of it might eventually be shared outside of Spyglass and \n",
    "they will not reflect any modifications that you have made to \n",

    "`DataAcquisitionDevice`, `Lab`, `Probe`, and `BrainRegion`. \n",
