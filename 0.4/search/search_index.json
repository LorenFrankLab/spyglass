An experimental session is defined as a collection of such objects. When an NWB file is ingested into <code>spyglass</code>, the information about these objects is first read and inserted into tables in the <code>common</code> module (e.g. <code>Institution</code>, <code>Lab</code>, <code>Electrode</code>, etc). However, not every NWB file has all the information required by <code>spyglass</code>. For example, many NWB files do not contain any information about the <code>DataAcquisitionDevice</code> or <code>Probe</code> because NWB does not yet have an official standard for specifying them. In addition, one might find that the information contained in the NWB file is incorrect and would like to modify it before inserting it into <code>spyglass</code> without having to go through the time-consuming process of re-generating the NWB file. For these cases, we provide an alternative approach to inserting data to <code>spyglass</code>.</p> <p>This alternate approach consists of two steps. First, the user must identify entries that they would like to add to the <code>spyglass</code> database that exist independently of any particular NWB file. For example, information about a particular probe is stored in the <code>ProbeType</code> and <code>Probe</code> tables of <code>spyglass.common</code>. The user can either:</p> <ol> <li> <p>create these entries programmatically using DataJoint <code>insert</code> commands, for    example:</p> <pre><code>sgc.ProbeType.insert1({\n\"probe_type\": \"128c-4s6mm6cm-15um-26um-sl\",\n\"probe_description\": \"A Livermore flexible probe with 128 channels, 4 shanks, 6 mm shank length, 6 cm ribbon length. 15 um contact diameter, 26 um center-to-center distance (pitch), single-line configuration.\",\n\"manufacturer\": \"Lawrence Livermore National Lab\",\n\"num_shanks\": 4,\n}, skip_duplicates=True)\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>define these entries in a special YAML file called <code>entries.yaml</code> that is    processed when <code>spyglass</code> is imported. One can think of <code>entries.yaml</code> as a    place to define information that the database should come pre-equipped prior    to ingesting any NWB files. The <code>entries.yaml</code> file should be placed in the    <code>spyglass</code> base directory. An example can be found in    <code>examples/config_yaml/entries.yaml</code>. It has the following structure:</p> <pre><code>TableName:\n- TableEntry1Field1: Value\nTableEntry1Field2: Value\n- TableEntry2Field1: Value\nTableEntry2Field2: Value\n</code></pre> <p>For example,</p> <pre><code>ProbeType:\n- probe_type: 128c-4s6mm6cm-15um-26um-sl\nprobe_description: A Livermore flexible probe with 128 channels, 4 shanks, 6 mm shank length, 6 cm ribbon length. 15 um contact diameter, 26 um center-to-center distance (pitch), single-line configuration.\nmanufacturer: Lawrence Livermore National Lab\nnum_shanks: 4\n</code></pre> </li> </ol> <p>Using a YAML file over programmatically creating these entries in a notebook or script has the advantages that the YAML file maintains a record of what entries have been added that is easy to access, and the file is portable and can be shared alongside an NWB file or set of NWB files from a given experiment.</p> <p>Next, the user must associate the NWB file with entries defined in the database. This is done by cresqating a configuration file, which must: be in the same directory as the NWB file that it configures be in YAML format have the following naming convention: <code>&lt;name_of_nwb_file&gt;_spyglass_config.yaml</code>.</p> <p>Users can programmatically generate this configuration file. It is then read by spyglass when calling <code>insert_session</code> on the associated NWB file.</p> <p>An example of this can be found at <code>examples/config_yaml/\u200b\u200bsub-AppleBottom_ses-AppleBottom-DY20-g3_behavior+ecephys_spyglass_config.yaml</code>. This file is associated with the NWB file <code>sub-AppleBottom_ses-AppleBottom-DY20-g3_behavior+ecephys.nwb</code>.</p> <p>This is the general format for the config entry:</p> <pre><code>TableName:\n- primary_key1: value1\n</code></pre> <p>For example:</p> <pre><code>DataAcquisitionDevice:\n- data_acquisition_device_name: Neuropixels Recording Device\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, the NWB file that corresponds to this config YAML will become associated with the DataAcquisitionDevice with primary key data_acquisition_device_name: Neuropixels Recording Device.

Only the members of a lab team will be able to delete table entries they made (this permission system is not yet implemented; we're working on it).

It has a parts table called <code>LabMemberInfo</code>, where the Google account of each member can be found (for authentication purposes). Similarly, <code>LabTeam</code> table contains the list of lab teams and has a parts table called <code>LabTeamMember</code> which specifies which of the lab members (as entered in <code>LabMember</code>) belongs to each lab team. Both <code>LabMember</code> and <code>LabTeam</code> are <code>dj.Manual</code> tables, which means the data can be entered manually (although when we add our NWB file with <code>nd.insert_sessions(nwb_file_name)</code>, the owner of the NWB file (as specified in the <code>experimenter</code> field) is automatically entered into <code>LabMember</code> table).</p> <p>To proceed, we will create a new team using the <code>create_new_team</code> method of <code>LabTeam</code>. You will give this team a name, and add yourself (and your Google account) to this team. Later, when we do spike sorting, we will specify the team the sorting belongs to.

Alternatively, run the following cell and click on the URL output.</p> In\u00a0[17]: Copied! <pre># workspace_uri = (SpikeSorting &amp; {'nwb_file_name': nwb_file_name2}).fetch1('curation_feed_uri')\n# print(f'https://sortingview.vercel.app/workspace?workspace={workspace_uri}&amp;channel=franklab')\n</pre> # workspace_uri = (SpikeSorting &amp; {'nwb_file_name': nwb_file_name2}).fetch1('curation_feed_uri') # print(f'https://sortingview.vercel.app/workspace?workspace={workspace_uri}&amp;channel=franklab') <p>This will take you to a workspace on the <code>sortingview</code> app. The workspace, which you can think of as a list of recording and associated sorting objects, was created at the end of spike sorting. On the workspace view, you will see a set of recordings that have been added to the workspace.</p> <p></p> <p>Clicking on a recording then takes you to a page that gives you information about the recording as well as the associated sorting objects.</p> <p></p> <p>Click on a sorting to see the curation view. Try exploring the many visualization widgets.</p> <p></p> <p>The most important is the <code>Units Table</code> and the <code>Curation</code> menu, which allows you to give labels to the units. The curation labels will persist even if you suddenly lose connection to the app; this is because the curaiton actions are appended to the workspace as soon as they are created. Note that if you are not logged in with your Google account, <code>Curation</code> menu may not be visible.

Each edge consists of a pair of nodes. Each node is labeled by their respective index in <code>node_positions</code>. For example, (79.910, 216.720) is the 2D position of node 0 and (183.784, 45.375) is the 2D position of node 8.

As before, each edge consists of a pair of nodes, which are labeled by their index. The order of the nodes controls their order in 1D space.

This involves populating a series of tables (<code>SpikeSorting</code> -&gt; <code>CuratedSpikeSorting</code> -&gt; <code>UnitMarks</code> -&gt; <code>UnitMarkIndicators</code>)</p> <p>This may seem confusing at first, as the point of clusterless decoding is to avoid spike sorting. However, in order to keep the pipeline for spike sorting and clusterless mark extraction similar as possible, we use some shared steps. However, the \"spike sorting\" step involves just a simple thresholding operation (sorter: clusterless_thresholder) and the curation step is essentially skipped (although the entry still needs to be populated). It also make sense to only extract the mark indicator functions time periods where there is position data.</p> <p>In order to simplify some of these steps, there is a function called <code>populate_mark_indicators</code>. In order to use it, you must first populate <code>SpikeSortingSelection</code> and <code>IntervalPositionInfo</code>.</p> <p>Note that <code>SpikeSortingSelection</code> itself depends on:</p> <ul> <li><code>SpikeSortingRecording</code></li> <li><code>SpikeSorterParameters</code></li> <li><code>ArtifactRemovedIntervalList</code>.</li> </ul> <p>and <code>SpikeSortingRecording</code> itself depends on:</p> <ul> <li><code>SortGroup</code></li> <li><code>SortInterval</code></li> <li><code>SpikeSortingPreprocessingParameters</code></li> <li><code>LabTeam</code></li> </ul> <p>You will have to define/populate all these things before getting to the \"spike sorting\" step.
