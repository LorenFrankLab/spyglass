Because our experiments can be long, sometimes there   are missing samples. This can be due to many reasons, such as the commutator   connection being faulty for a few milliseconds.

An experimental session is defined as a collection of such objects. When an NWB file is ingested into <code>spyglass</code>, the information about these objects is first read and inserted into tables in the <code>common</code> module (e.g. <code>Institution</code>, <code>Lab</code>, <code>Electrode</code>, etc). However, not every NWB file has all the information required by <code>spyglass</code>. For example, many NWB files do not contain any information about the <code>DataAcquisitionDevice</code> or <code>Probe</code> because NWB does not yet have an official standard for specifying them. In addition, one might find that the information contained in the NWB file is incorrect and would like to modify it before inserting it into <code>spyglass</code> without having to go through the time-consuming process of re-generating the NWB file. For these cases, we provide an alternative approach to inserting data to <code>spyglass</code>.</p> <p>This alternate approach consists of two steps. First, the user must identify entries that they would like to add to the <code>spyglass</code> database that exist independently of any particular NWB file. For example, information about a particular probe is stored in the <code>ProbeType</code> and <code>Probe</code> tables of <code>spyglass.common</code>. The user can either:</p> <ol> <li> <p>create these entries programmatically using DataJoint <code>insert</code> commands, for    example:</p> <p><code>python sgc.ProbeType.insert1({ \"probe_type\": \"128c-4s6mm6cm-15um-26um-sl\", \"probe_description\": \"A Livermore flexible probe with 128 channels, 4 shanks, 6 mm shank length, 6 cm ribbon length. 15 um contact diameter, 26 um center-to-center distance (pitch), single-line configuration.\", \"manufacturer\": \"Lawrence Livermore National Lab\", \"num_shanks\": 4, }, skip_duplicates=True)</code></p> </li> <li> <p>define these entries in a special YAML file called <code>entries.yaml</code> that is    processed when <code>spyglass</code> is imported. One can think of <code>entries.yaml</code> as a    place to define information that the database should come pre-equipped prior    to ingesting any NWB files. The <code>entries.yaml</code> file should be placed in the    <code>spyglass</code> base directory. An example can be found in    <code>examples/config_yaml/entries.yaml</code>. It has the following structure:</p> <p><code>yaml TableName: - TableEntry1Field1: Value TableEntry1Field2: Value - TableEntry2Field1: Value TableEntry2Field2: Value</code></p> <p>For example,</p> <p><code>yaml ProbeType: - probe_type: 128c-4s6mm6cm-15um-26um-sl probe_description: A Livermore flexible probe with 128 channels, 4 shanks, 6 mm shank length, 6 cm ribbon length. 15 um contact diameter, 26 um center-to-center distance (pitch), single-line configuration. manufacturer: Lawrence Livermore National Lab num_shanks: 4</code></p> </li> </ol> <p>Using a YAML file over programmatically creating these entries in a notebook or script has the advantages that the YAML file maintains a record of what entries have been added that is easy to access, and the file is portable and can be shared alongside an NWB file or set of NWB files from a given experiment.</p> <p>Next, the user must associate the NWB file with entries defined in the database. This is done by cresqating a configuration file, which must: be in the same directory as the NWB file that it configures be in YAML format have the following naming convention: <code>&lt;name_of_nwb_file&gt;_spyglass_config.yaml</code>.</p> <p>Users can programmatically generate this configuration file. It is then read by spyglass when calling <code>insert_session</code> on the associated NWB file.</p> <p>An example of this can be found at <code>examples/config_yaml/\u200b\u200bsub-AppleBottom_ses-AppleBottom-DY20-g3_behavior+ecephys_spyglass_config.yaml</code>. This file is associated with the NWB file <code>sub-AppleBottom_ses-AppleBottom-DY20-g3_behavior+ecephys.nwb</code>.</p> <p>This is the general format for the config entry:</p> <pre><code>TableName:\n- primary_key1: value1\n</code></pre> <p>For example:</p> <pre><code>DataAcquisitionDevice:\n- data_acquisition_device_name: Neuropixels Recording Device\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, the NWB file that corresponds to this config YAML will become associated with the DataAcquisitionDevice with primary key data_acquisition_device_name: Neuropixels Recording Device.

It corresponds to the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel used to smooth the speed and is in units of seconds.

To summarize, we brought in a pretrained DLC project, used that model to run pose estimation on a new behavioral video, smoothed and interpolated the result, formed a cohort of bodyparts, and determined the centroid and orientation of this cohort. Whew! Now let's populate <code>DLCPos</code> with our centroid and orientation entries from above.---- To begin, we'll make a key that combines the cohort names we used for the orientation and centroid as well as the params names for both.</p> In\u00a0[\u00a0]: Copied! <pre>fields = list(sgp.DLCPosV1.fetch().dtype.fields.keys())\ndlc_key = {key: val for key, val in centroid_key.items() if key in fields}\ndlc_key[\"dlc_si_cohort_centroid\"] = centroid_key[\"dlc_si_cohort_selection_name\"]\ndlc_key[\"dlc_si_cohort_orientation\"] = orient_key[\n    \"dlc_si_cohort_selection_name\"\n]\ndlc_key[\"dlc_orientation_params_name\"] = orient_key[\n    \"dlc_orientation_params_name\"\n]\nprint(dlc_key)\n</pre> fields = list(sgp.DLCPosV1.fetch().dtype.fields.keys()) dlc_key = {key: val for key, val in centroid_key.items() if key in fields} dlc_key[\"dlc_si_cohort_centroid\"] = centroid_key[\"dlc_si_cohort_selection_name\"] dlc_key[\"dlc_si_cohort_orientation\"] = orient_key[     \"dlc_si_cohort_selection_name\" ] dlc_key[\"dlc_orientation_params_name\"] = orient_key[     \"dlc_orientation_params_name\" ] print(dlc_key) <p>Now we can insert into <code>DLCPosSelection</code> and populate <code>DLCPos</code> with our <code>dlc_key</code></p> In\u00a0[\u00a0]: Copied! <pre>sgp.DLCPosSelection().insert1(dlc_key, skip_duplicates=True)\nsgp.DLCPosV1().populate(dlc_key)\n</pre> sgp.DLCPosSelection().insert1(dlc_key, skip_duplicates=True) sgp.DLCPosV1().populate(dlc_key) <p>We can also make sure that all of our data made it through by fetching the dataframe attached to this entry.We should expect 8 columns:</p> <p>timevideo_frame_indposition_xposition_yorientationvelocity_xvelocity_yspeed</p> In\u00a0[\u00a0]: Copied! <pre>(sgp.DLCPosV1() &amp; dlc_key).fetch1_dataframe()\n</pre> (sgp.DLCPosV1() &amp; dlc_key).fetch1_dataframe() <p>And even more, we can fetch the <code>pose_eval_result</code> that is calculated during this step.

Each edge consists of a pair of nodes. Each node is labeled by their respective index in <code>node_positions</code>. For example, (79.910, 216.720) is the 2D position of node 0 and (183.784, 45.375) is the 2D position of node 8.

As before, each edge consists of a pair of nodes, which are labeled by their index. The order of the nodes controls their order in 1D space.

In the future this will be a pipeline, but for now it is manual as the table structure is still being prototyped.</p> <p>In order to set the parameters, we can fetch the default parameters and modify them.</p> <p>For 1D decoding, it is best to pass in the track graph and track graph parameters we used for linearization in order for the random walk to be handled properly. We can also set the amount of smoothing in the position and mark dimensions: <code>position_std</code> and <code>mark_std</code> respectively. Finally we set the <code>block_size</code>, which controls how many samples get processed at a time so that we don't run out of GPU memory.</p>"}, {"location": "notebooks/10_1D_Clusterless_Decoding/#visualization", "title": "Visualization\u00b6", "text": "<p>Finally, we can plot the decodes to make sure they make sense.
