        Uses a RestrGraph to capture all upstream tables, restrict them to

        upstream tables have changed during a no-transaction populate and avoid
        the following data-integrity error:

        1. User A starts no-transaction populate.
        2. User B deletes and repopulates an upstream table, changing contents.
        3. User A finishes populate, inserting data that is now invalid.
