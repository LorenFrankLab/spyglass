"""Fixtures for the modern spike sorting test suite.

The repository-wide ``tests/conftest.py`` defines a session-scoped, autouse
``mini_insert`` fixture that starts a Docker MySQL server and ingests the
shared sample NWB file. The scaffold and pure-helper tests in this package
exercise Pydantic models and pure helpers only -- they need neither a
database connection nor sample data. This module overrides ``mini_insert``
with a no-op so those tests run without Docker. Database-tier tests
(the MEArec fixture ingestion round-trip) request ``dj_conn`` directly
and expect Docker to be available.

The fixture/baseline generator scripts and the standalone bootstrap helper
are filtered out of collection so pytest does not try to import them as test
modules (their ``test_`` prefixes are coincidental component names).
