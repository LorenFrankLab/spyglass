"""Unit tests for LinearizedPositionV1 with mocked external operations.

These tests use monkeypatch to replace expensive external operations (track_linearization)
with instant mock functions, allowing fast validation of Spyglass logic without waiting
for slow computations.

Runtime: ~1-2s (vs ~25s for integration tests)

    This test validates:
    - LinearizedPositionV1.populate() executes without errors

    - _compute_linearized_position() - Returns fake linearized position instantly
    - _save_linearization_results() - Returns fake object_id instantly
