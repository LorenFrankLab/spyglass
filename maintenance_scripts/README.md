# Frank Lab Maintenance Scripts

Scripts in this directory are used to maintain the database, set to run
regularly as cron jobs.

## Scripts

- `alter_table.py`
    - This script is used to alter all tables according to the latest Spyglass
        definitions.
    - If the lab follows instructions in release notes, this is unnecessary.
- `cleanup.py`
    - This script performs various cleanup operations on the database, including
        removing orphans, unreferenced files, and old temp files.
    - The function for cleaning up temp files requires that this directory be
        called either `temp` or `tmp`.
    - This script also fetches the latest version information from PyPI to update
        the `SpyglassVersions` table.
- `populate.py` - This script provides an example of how to run computations as
    part of cron jobs. This is not currently in use.
- `run_jobs.sh` - This script ...
    - Reads from the `.env` file in the same directory.
    - Updates the spyglass repository, fetching from the master branch.
    - Runs a database connection check (relying on a valid datajoint config).
    - Runs the `cleanup.py` script.
- `check_disk_space.sh` - This script ...
    - Reads from the same `.env` file as `run_jobs.sh`.
    - Checks the disk space of each drive in `SPACE_CHECK_DRIVES`
    - Calculate the percent available relative to `SPACE_PERCENT_LIMIT`.
    - If above, sends an email for each drive to each recipient listed in
        `SPACE_EMAIL_RECIPENTS`.
    - If provided with `SLACK_TOKEN` and `SLACK_CHANNEL`, posts a message to
        slack.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to the desired location.
2. Set up a config file by copying `dj_local_conf_example.json` to
    `dj_local_conf.json` and filling in the necessary information.
3. Copy the `example.env` file to `.env` in the `maintenance_scripts` directory
    and fill in the necessary information, including...
4. Set up a cron job to run `run_jobs.sh` at the desired interval by running
    - Items for running cleanup jobs:
        - `SPYGLASS_CHMOD_FILES`: if `true`, the script will set the permissions of
            all files in the data directory to 644. This is limited to files
            generated in the last week to save time. If `false`, the script will
            skip this step.[^1]
        - `SPYGLASS_BASE_PATH`: the path to the Spyglass-managed data.
        - `SPYGLASS_CONDA_PATH`: Path to conda initialization script. To find the
            root directory, run `which conda` and follow the relative path in
            `example.env`
        - `SPYGLASS_CONDA_ENV`: the name of the conda environment with Spyglass and
            DataJoint installed.[^2]
        - `SPYGLASS_REPO_PATH`: the path to the Spyglass repository.
        - `SPYGLASS_LOG`: the path to the log file.
        - Optional email settings. If not set, email notifications will not be
            sent.
            - `SPYGLASS_EMAIL_SRC`: The email address from which to send
                notifications.
            - `SPYGLASS_EMAIL_PASS`: the password for the email address.
            - `SPYGLASS_EMAIL_DEST`: the email address to which to send
                notifications.
    - Items for checking disk space:
        - `TZ`: the timezone to use reporting local times.
        - `SPACE_PERCENT_LIMIT`: the percentage of disk space below which to send
            notifications.
        - `SPACE_CHECK_DRIVES`: a space-separated list of drives to check.
        - `SPACE_LOG`: the path to the log file.
        - `SPACE_EMAIL_SRC`/`SPACE_EMAIL_PASS`: email sender settings for disk
            space notifications.
        - `SPACE_EMAIL_RECIPENTS`: a space-separated list of email addresses to
            receive disk space notifications.
    - Items for posting to slack:
        - `SLACK_TOKEN`: the token for the slack app.
        - `SLACK_CHANNEL`: the channel to post to.
5. Set up a cron job to run each shell script at the desired interval by running
    `crontab -e` and adding the script.

Note that the log file will automatically be truncated to `SPYGLASS_MAX_LOG`
lines on each run. 1000 lines should be sufficient.

To enable slack notifications, you will need to create a slack app and generate
a token following the instructions
[here](https://api.slack.com/tutorials/tracks/posting-messages-with-curl). For
posting to a private channel, you will need to invite the app to the relevant
channel before attempting to post.

### Example Cron Jobs

In the following example, the cleanup script is set to run every Monday at 4:00
AM, and the disk space check is set to run every day at 8:00 AM.

```text
0 4 * * 1 /path/to/run_jobs.sh
0 8 * * * /path/to/check_disk_space.sh
```

### Email Service

The script uses `curl` to send email notifications on failure. While this can
work with
[many email services](https://everything.curl.dev/usingcurl/smtp.html), Gmail is
a common choice. To use Gmail, you will need to ...

1. Turn on [2-step verification](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup)
2. Turn on [less secure apps](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps)
3. Create an [app password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)

`curl` will not work with your master Gmail password, so you will need to use
the app password instead.

[^1]: Depending your system, you may need to run the script as `sudo` to set the
    permissions.

[^2]: You may want to run the cronjob from a dedicated conda environment to avoid
    issues with local editable installs or other package conflicts.
